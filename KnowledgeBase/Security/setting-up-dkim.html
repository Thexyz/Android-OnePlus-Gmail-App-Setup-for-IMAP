Protect your Email with <a title="DKIM" href="https://www.thexyz.com/account/index.php/knowledgebase/64/What-is-DKIM.html">DKIM </a>(Domain Keys Identified Mail). DKIM adds a secure signature to your domain to authenticate email sent from users in your company. DKIM is an industry best practice that increases the security of your email: <br />
<ul>
<li>Spend less time removing your domains from spam blacklists</li>
<li>Spend less time working with users after they have fallen for phishing attempts</li>
<li>Increase confidence and trust with email service providers that emails sent from your domain are not fraudulent</li>
</ul>
Setting up DKIM is easy and can be completed in less than 5 minutes. To enable DKIM on your domain, you must have access to your domain's DNS settings through a provider like GoDaddy, Network Solutions, 1and1, etc. To generate DKIM keys you will need to login the Email Adminitsration Portal: <a href="https://admin.thexyz.com" target="_blank">https://admin.thexyz.com</a><br /><br />Once logged in you can click on: <strong>Sender Authentication (DKIM)<br /><br /><img title="DKIM" src="https://www.thexyz.com/account/downloads/img/dkim-1.png" alt="" width="980" height="231" /><br /><br /></strong>From the next screen you can click on the domain you wish to add DKIM Authentication to as picture below.<br /><br /><img title="DKIM" src="https://www.thexyz.com/account/downloads/img/dkim-2.png" alt="Select domain for DKIM" width="717" height="182" /><br /><br />Click the button to enable DKIM for your domain name.<br /><br /><img title="Enable DKIM" src="https://www.thexyz.com/account/downloads/img/dkim-4.png" alt="Enable DKIM" width="597" height="156" /><br /><br />Once enabled you will see the TXT record DKIM to add to your domain. You can copy the record text to clipboard and then edit your domain DNS settings. Once these changes have propagated (can take 1 to 24 hours depending on domain registrar) you will be able to validate the TXT record.<br /><br /><br /><img title="DKIM Keys" src="https://www.thexyz.com/account/downloads/img/dkim-3.png" alt="DKIM Keys" width="1254" height="759" /><br /><br />There are also guides created for adding these DNS records with the following domain registrars or DNS hosting services.<br /><br />
