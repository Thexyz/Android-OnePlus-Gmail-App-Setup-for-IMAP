<h1>1. Edit MX Records (required)</h1>
<p>An MX record is a type of DNS record that defines which mail servers are used to deliver email that is sent to anyone on your domain. In order to create a custom email address for your domain to be able to send and receive emails through your domain or create <span class="items"><span class="item"> email aliases</span></span>, you will need to update the <a title="MX records for Thexyz" href="https://www.thexyz.com/forum/discussion/2163/mx-records-for-setting-up-thexyz-hosted-email">MX record values</a> through your DNS host to point to Thexyz. The two MX records are listed below with the priority numbers. <br /><br />Record: <strong>mx1.emailsrvr.com</strong><br />Priority: 10<br />TTL: Lowest possible<br /><br />Record 2: <strong>mx2.emailsrvr.com</strong><br />Priority: 20<br />TTL: Lowest possible<br /><br /><em>You should also delete any existing MX records as it will interfere.</em> <br /><br />We have some additional step by step guides for demonstrating how to edit your MX records when you DNS is hosted with <a title="Godaddy MX record change" href="https://www.thexyz.com/forum/discussion/1955/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Godaddy</a>, <a title="Edit MX records at Register.com" href="https://www.thexyz.com/forum/discussion/1954/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Register.com</a> or <a title="Edit MX records for WordPress domain" href="https://www.thexyz.com/forum/discussion/2127/how-to-setup-email-with-wordpress-com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress</a> or via your <span class="items"><span class="item">web hostingif DNS is hosted there. <br /></span></span></p>
<h1> 2. Add An SPF Record (recommended)</h1>
<p>Ensure your outbound email reaches email inboxes and not the spam folder by <a href="https://www.thexyz.com/account/knowledgebase/95/How-to-create-an-SPF-record.html">adding an SPF record</a> to your DNS will allow you to specify the email servers you use to send email from your domain. This validates your sending domain email address when you send mail, which can help to keep your domain’s email out of your recipients’ spam folders and keeps email protected. To add the SPF record you need to add a TXT record via your domain DNS hosting and point to the following:<br /><br />TXT Record: <strong>v=spf1 include:emailsrvr.com ~all</strong><br />Host name: Either <strong>@</strong> or blank<br />TTL: Lowest possible<br /><br /></p>

<h1>3. Enable DKIM Authentication (recommended)</h1>
<p>We highly recommend setting up DKIM on your domain to ensure your email is protected against spoofing. To generate DKIM keys you will need to login the Email Administration Portal: <a title="Thexyz Email Admin Portal" href="https://admin.thexyz.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://admin.thexyz.com</a><br /><br />Please check the guide below to enable DKIM on your domain. <br /><br /></p>

<h1>4. Add Autodiscover Setup (optional)</h1>
<p><a title="Enable AutoDiscover" href="https://www.thexyz.com/forum/discussion/2156/how-to-enable-autodiscover-for-thexyz-email" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Autodiscover</a> is a service that allows users to easily configure their email client knowing only their email address and password. This makes setting up email on different clients and devices much easier.<br /><br />Login to where your domain is registered or DNS hosted and create the following CNAME record:<br /><br />Record Type: CNAME<br />Host name: <strong>autodiscover</strong><br />TTL: Lowest possible<br />Address: <strong>autodiscover.emailsrvr.com</strong></p>
