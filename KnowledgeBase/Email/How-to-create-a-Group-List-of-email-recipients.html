<p>A Group List enables someone to communicate with groups of people using a single email address. Group lists are commonly used by departments in an organization, project teams, or if there is a need to reach all employees at a company. For example, suppose that you have a billing team you want to group together - bob@domain.com, amy@domain.com, and scott@domain.com. You can create a contact group list for the team so that they can communicate new upcoming billing updates within the team, at <a href="mailto:billing@domain.com">billing@domain.com</a>.<br /><br />There is no limit to the number of internal address (addresses within your domain) and a limit of 250 additional members outside of the domain.<br /><br />Log in to <a title="Thexyz Email Admin Login" href="https://admin.thexyz.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thexyz Email Admin Control Panel</a>.<br /><br />In the <strong>Email Hosting</strong> section, click <strong>Group Lists</strong>.<br /><br /><img src="https://www.thexyz.com/images/group-lists1.png" alt="Group Email Lists" width="854" height="480" /><br /><br />On this page you can either import a Group List from an excel file (<a href="https://www.thexyz.com/account/dl.php?type=d&amp;id=58" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>download template here</em></a>) or click <strong>Add Group List</strong> to create a distribution list.</p>
